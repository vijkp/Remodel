                                 REMODEL

WHAT IS REMODEL?                   

  Remodel is a replacement program for 'make'. 'make' takes a series of
  dependencies and builds targets by executing commands. Its use of UNIX
  timestamps as a happens-before relation means that it can fail to build
  properly. This is especially true during parallel builds. 

  Remodel will also take a series of dependencies and targets, etc. (grammar
  below), but unlike make, it will use MD5 hashes to detect new content and
  provide, together with the dependency chain, a happens-before relation 
  (md5diff(oldA,newA) => everything that depends on A must be rebuilt). It
  executes all independent (non-conflicting) commands in parallel, using
  threads or processes. 

  Remodel uses a different grammar than make. Dependencies can appear in 
  any order. If you execute remodel with no arguments, it should start with
  the pseudo-target DEFAULT. Otherwise, the root is the argument to remodel,
  as in remodel foo.o. 

      program ::= production*
      production ::= target '<-' dependency (':' '"' command '"")
      dependency ::= filename (',' filename)*
      target ::= filename (',' filename)*

  Here's an example that builds the program baz from two source files,
  foo.cpp and bar.cpp. 

      DEFAULT <- baz
      baz <- foo.o, bar.o: "g++ foo.o bar.o -o baz"
      foo.o <- foo.cpp : "g++ -c foo.cpp -o foo.o"
      bar.o <- bar.cpp: "g++ -c bar.cpp -o bar.o"

PLATFORM AND DEPENDENCIES
  * Platform: linux
  * Dependencies: openssl, glibc (package name libssl-dev) 
  * Compiler: gcc 4.6
  * Programming Language: C

HOW TO USE REMODEL?
  * Change directory to 'remodel' source directory.
  * Before building remodel make sure that 'libssl-dev' and 'gcc' are installed.
  * Run 'make' for building remodel for testing.
  * Alternatively, use 'make debug' command to build a debug build. Debug buildi
    is useful while debugging. It builds the project with gdb flags and enables
    debug log messages. Make sure to run make clean before switching from
    debug to prod build and vice versa.
  * Build generates the binary remodel .
  * Change to any test directory and run remodel either by copying remodel 
    binary to test directory or providing the full path to remodel .
